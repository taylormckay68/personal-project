            <h4>About Southwest Chiropractic</h4>
            </br>
            <p>Dr. Brad Peterson, DC, is a chiropractor who serves the South Jordan area in Salt Lake City, Utah. As a college
                student, Dr. Peterson incurred a serious back and neck injury that sent him to the chiropractor whose office
                happened to be next door to Dr. Peterson's apartment. As he learned from the doctor, and even began to work
                for him, Dr. Peterson discovered a new direction for his life and entered Palmer College of Chiropractic-West.
                After graduation in 1987, Dr. Peterson began his private practice and has continued to serve his patients
                since that time. In his own words: “Being a chiropractic student … taught me about the wholeness of the body
                and the control of the nervous system. I developed a deep respect for what it means to be human. The miracle
                of the body, the power of the nervous system, and the impact of stress on these systems fascinated me … every
                time I asked my patients, 'How are you?' I received a gift in the form of their trust and confidence in me
                and chiropractic to get them well.”
